# BYU CS312 Algorithm Analysis
Python Algorithm Class Projects

* Lab 1 - Primality Test: I implemented the prime number test based on Fermat's little theorem.
* Lab 2 - Convex Hull: This project was to implement a divide and conquer algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points.
* Lab 3 - Network Routing: In this project I used Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find paths through a graph representing a network routing problem. I used two different data structures to implement a priority queue in order to see that both algorithm design *and* data structure implementation significantly affect performance.
* Lab 4 - Gene Sequencing: In this project, I implemented two versions of a dynamic programming algorithm for computing the minimal cost of aligning gene sequences and extracting (an) optimal alignment.
* Labs 5 and 6 - Traveling Salesperson: In this project, I implemented a branch and bound algorithm to find solutions to the traveling salesperson problem (TSP) and worked in a small group to compare accuracy and the theoretical and empirical complexity of different algorithmic "solutions" to the traveling salesmen problem (TSP), including greedy, branch and bound, and the Held-Karp algorithm.

Note: all programs are run through the GUI file.  For example run `python3 Proj1GUI.py` to run the primality testing lab.
